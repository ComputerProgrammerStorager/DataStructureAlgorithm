# DataStructureAlgorithm
This contains data structure and algorithms.   \

If you suspect or doubt the importance of data structure and algorithm, please rethink your thought :-) \

Here are some good resources:\
1. Text books and Lectures\
    a. The Algorithm Design Mannual by Prof. Steven S. Skiena\
    b. Introduction to Algorithm by CLRS\
    c. Algorithms by Robert SedgeWick at Princeton (coursera).\
    d. Data Structures taught at UC Berkeley (https://sp18.datastructur.es/)\
    e. Algorithms by Jeff Erickson (http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/index.html#models)\

2. If you want to explore the ghost behind, consider feeding yourself these\
    a. Discrete Mathematicas \
    b. Combinatoric Math\
    c. Probability Theory \
    d. Number Theory \
    e. Concrete Mathematicas (this covers the above)\
    f. The Art of Computer Programming by Knuth (ultimately) \
